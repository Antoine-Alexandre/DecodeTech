What are the economic and societal changes brought about by the use of AI? And how could these technologies affect the global balance of power? 

## Current debates
Hardly a week goes by without some new applications of artificial intelligence (AI) making the headlines. While these articles used to describe exciting usages of this family of technologies a couple of years ago, they now tend to focus on [poor predictions](https://hbr.org/2022/03/why-ai-failed-to-live-up-to-its-potential-during-the-pandemic), [built-in biases](https://hbr.org/2022/03/overcoming-the-c-suites-distrust-of-ai) and [misuse of systems](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/3/30/23001712/ai-research-virus-scientific-information-dangerous) deployed in the private and public sectors alike. Growing attention has (rightly) been paid to the sources of potential drawbacks of AI-based systems. By contrast, there is still little media coverage of the more profound global societal changes and threats resulting from the use of these technologies.

## AI’s impacts on geopolitics
On the global stage, a competition is underway as international actors strive to position themselves at the forefront of AI innovation. One of the biggest impacts of this “race to AI” is its potential to disrupt the distribution of power and control, affecting states, private companies, and individuals in various different forms. Development and deployment of AI-based systems are driving swift societal and economic changes, with wide-reaching implications on the global scene. Let’s briefly explore them!

##### 1. Transforming economies 
One of the things economists agree on is that AI-based technologies will revolutionise many sectors, transform business models and change the way economic actors interact with each other. Yet, potential economic gains and losses remain difficult to predict as countries have economic specificities and AI is not affecting all industries at the same pace. Also, if AI is ([as often depicted](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ibm/2020/03/04/how-ai-is-driving-the-new-industrial-revolution/)) like the industrial revolution in its transformative potentials, failing to adopt these technologies will have economic repercussions and could lead to increasing inequalities within and between countries. 

- ###### Labour productivity and labour markets
First, domestic and international labor markets will be affected by the adoption of AI-based systems. While the use of AI in sectors (such as manufacturing and transport) could lead to significant productivity gains, it would most likely be deployed to replace manual and cognitive work, thereby diminishing intrinsic values of low and mid-skilled workers. Also, given the speed of technological changes, it is unclear how fast education systems could adapt to address resulting skills gaps between those benefiting (mostly high-skilled IT workers) and the rest of the workforce, which could result in increase in unemployment and inequalities. 

- ###### Winner takes all
Then, companies that develop AI tools early on will most probably have a first mover advantage: once productivity gains would have been achieved, front runners (mainly located in developed countries) would be able to gradually attract more and more of the profit pool of their industry and use these profits to stop their competitors (through price competition, acquisition, etc). This can have significant international consequences. Among other things, low developed countries could face increasing difficulties in maintaining their global competitiveness. In addition, AI-based technologies could make it economical for some manufacturers to repatriate production from poorer countries, widening international inequality even further.

##### 2. Challenging democracies 
AI can further threaten foundational principles of democracy itself. Indeed, this family of technlogies is both ubiquitous and elusive. Its apparent pervasiveness in both private and public hands is apt to breed confusion and concern. Whether used for the benefit of the people or against them, new types of challenges are emerging regarding both the purpose and effectiveness of specific AI systems.  

- ###### Mass surveillance
From facial recognition to social scoring, AI-based technologies are redefining the scale and accuracy of public (and private) surveillance. The reason mass surveillance has undergone such an upheaval over the past two decades is due to: 1. the growing public acceptance of constant monitoring since 09/11, 2. the minimization of the costs of cameras installed in public spaces, and 3. the exponential self-learning capabilities of AI, allowing systems to minimize errors with each new input data. Alongside privacy concerns and numerous ethical questions, simply deploying infrastructures designed to isolate individuals and track them over time and space increases the likelihood of domestic and foreign exploitation of these systems for detrimental purposes. 

- ###### Micro-targeting and “big nudging”
Also, by collecting and crossing data, private and public actors are able to segment people into groups and to target different messages and contents based on personal attributes. These AI-enabled profiling systems are constantly learning from our actions to  effectively steer us towards specific products, services, views, and beliefs. They raise questions about the right to self-determination and could easily be used to deceptively manipulate entire populations. 

##### 3. Reshaping public-private relationship 
Another distinctive aspect of AI systems is that they are, for the most part, developed by private actors. The fact that most of the AI expertise lies within companies thus significantly shift the power relationship between public and private entities. This evolution pushes new kinds of public-private partnerships forward, whereby the state has the difficult mission to set the right business conditions to increase development of AI and ensure its global competitiveness, while protecting fundamental rights and building trust in these technologies. Whether this development is beneficial to all citizens depends on a variety of factors that diverge tremendously across countries.  

- ###### Data, chips and engineering talent
Big tech companies have gather huge amount of data over the past 20 years. As already mentioned, this new type of raw material can now be used by these private actors to train AI systems and gain a serious competitive edge over competitors. Also, thanks to direct and indirect network effects and to their massive profits, these companies attract and finance a large proportion of talents capable of mastering the most advance AI technologies, thus strengthening their leadership position. Accordingly, we are currently witnessing a centralization of power where few private actors control the entire value chain, from the production of semiconductors to the supply of digital products and services. 

- ###### Standards organizations
At the ame time, the use of technical standards to support digital legislation is expanding, and today standards play a key role at regional and international level. While this new form of harmonisation tool should, in principle, not go beyond the implementation of mere technical aspects, in practice, and given the “liquid” nature of AI technologies, they tend to extend their scope of action, raising questions of democratic accountability. Combined with their relative opacity and domination of big private actors in the process, this new kind of public-private partnership can result in standards which do not meet the needs of all societal actors.

##### 4. Disrupting the warfare
Lastly, in the defence realm, functions that could be supported by AI-based systems are numerous and could bring about tremendous military evolutions. AI is depicted by [some](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/01/25/getting-to-grips-with-military-robotics) as having the potential to alter the immutable nature of war. [Others](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00396338.2018.1518374) acknowledge its potentials, but highlight primarily the psychological changes these technologies will have on strategic affairs. What is certain is that AI-based military applications have the potential to “reshuffle the deck” and allow middle powers to compete alongside bigger military players. 

- ###### Autonomous weapons
The first thing that come to mind when discussing AI and armaments is probably lethal autonomous weapon systems. The use of these AI-based machines, having the power and discretion to take lives without human involvement, raises important political, legal and moral questions. Already in 2019, UN Secretary-General António Guterres was [urging](https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/03/1035381) countries to take actions to ban these specific weapons. Yet, last year, a [UN report](https://undocs.org/Home/Mobile?FinalSymbol=S%2F2021%2F229&Language=E&DeviceType=Desktop&LangRequested=False) suggested the use of autonomous Turkish drones to kill enemy troops in Libya.

- ###### Cyberattacks and disinformation
Whether through the use of direct cyberattacks on critical national assets or through the dissemination of fake news, cyber warfare and AI are intimately linked as they influence and fuel each other. Used as a Trojan horse in both times of war and peace, these cyber operations have the benefit of being very difficult to detect. Also, they can be easily outsourced to all sorts of private and illegal groups, making them even more complicated to trace and counter. 

## Where to go from here? 
The stakes in the “race to AI” are often portrayed as an existential necessity to protect us from [digital authoritarianism](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2018/rise-digital-authoritarianism). As stressed by French President Emmanuel Macron in an [interview](https://www.wired.com/story/emmanuel-macron-talks-to-wired-about-frances-ai-strategy/) in 2018, 
> “if you want to manage your own choice of society, your choice of civilization, you have to be able to be an acting part of this AI revolution. That’s the condition of having a say in designing and defining the rules of AI.” 

It is true that global power could result from the use of AI systems. That being said, by promoting and relying more and more on these technologies, we are not making an innocuous choice. We are embracing a distinctive political and philosophical stance. Taking part in the “AI revolution” have strong societal and economic consequences that will impact states, private companies and individuals very differently. 

AI is not a “neutral tool”. Questions of morality, fairness, accountability, competitiveness and sovereignty will continue to arise as AI-based technologies develop and are further deployed. The disruptive potentials of these technologies is **real** and could disturb (for better or worse) the global balance of power. `Discussions on what the use of AI-based technologies entails at national and international level have only just begun, let's make sure they develop!`
