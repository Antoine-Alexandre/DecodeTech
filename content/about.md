# About

**DecodeTech** is a general-audience medium launched in April 2022 to explore and discuss how technologies are changing societies and impacting our lifes.  
***

# Start with why

One major observation is at the origin of this website: there exists very few European-centered, easily accessible, and independent platforms dedicated to the analysis of the digital world. 
***

# Our mission

Providing thoughts and analyses on technological developments in a format that is engaging, accessible, but at the same time informative for readers with all levels of expertise. 
***

# Our ambition

Opening the door for more people to participate in debates surrounding the deployment of technologies in society. 
***

# Topics covered

From privacy concerns, to smart cities and cryptocurrencies, we aim to cover technological topics that inspire us and spark societal debate.
